<H2>The NOTIFY Sample</H2>
<P>The NOTIFY Sample accompanies Chapter 9 and illustrates how to use an I/O Control operation to send a notification to a user-mode application.</P>
<P>The sample includes two components:</P>

<UL>
<LI>NOTIFY.SYS (SYS subdirectory) is a WDM driver for a non-existent hardware device. </LI>
<LI>TEST.EXE (TEST subdirectory) is a Win32 console program that tests NOTIFY.SYS.</LI></UL>

<H3>Building NOTIFY</H3>
<P>To build NOTIFY.SYS, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#wdmbuild">general instructions for building a WDM sample</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named NOTIFY.DSP in the SYS subdirectory.</P>
<P>To build TEST.EXE, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#usermodebuild">general instructions for building user-mode programs</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named TEST.DSP in the TEST subdirectory.</P>
<H3>Testing NOTIFY</H3>
<P>Install NOTIFY.SYS. Follow the general instructions for using <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#fastinst">FastInst</A> in Windows 2000 or Windows 98. The INF file is named SYS\DEVICE.INF.</P>
<P>To test NOTIFY, open a command prompt and launch TEST.EXE from the TEST\DEBUG subdirectory. TEST will use an I/O Control operation to communicate an event handle to NOTIFY and then wait for you to type a keystroke on the keyboard. You can perform three different tests:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Type a key. TEST will print a message to the effect that the event has happened, and then it will exit. </LI>
<LI>Type Ctrl+Break. TEST will exit. If you’re watching in a debugger, you should find that NOTIFY correctly cleans up. </LI>
<LI>Use the Device Manager to disable or remove the NOTIFY device. You will have to terminate TEST with Ctrl+Break, but you should find that NOTIFY correctly cleans up.</LI></UL>
